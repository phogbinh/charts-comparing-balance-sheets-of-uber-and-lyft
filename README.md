# Charts Comparing Balance Sheets of Uber and Lyft
## Description
This is the repository for a program written in `Python` using `Jupyter Notebook` that produces charts comparing the common-size balance sheets of Uber and Lyft from 2017 to 2019. This program is part of a project analyzing financial states of the two companies, which is implemented for the course *Introduction to Entrepreneurship and Finance* opened during the 2020 Spring Semester at the National Taipei University of Technology.
